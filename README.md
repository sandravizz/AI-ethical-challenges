"The first generation of graduate students is matriculating who are focused explicitly on the ethics and safety of machine learning. The alignment problem's first responders have arrived at the scene."
Brian Christian

## Module overview
Arcada is a multi-professional University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki (Finland) with the philosophy to work across disciplines and advance culture and knowledge. The curriculum of each degree programme at Arcada is composed of modules. The modules define the competencies that you need to attain in order to graduate.

## Competency aims
The aim of this course is to provide the students with knowledge about thoughtful, responsible, and ethical uses of machine learning practice, which is a fundamental precondition to trustworthy development of AI. Recommendation systems, which simultaneously shape and predict the future in nearly all parts of human life, will be the main use case during the course.

## Learning outcomes
At the end of the course the student is expected to have an understanding of the techniques behind automated decision making systems related to common ML practice, combined with the skill to judge if the decision seems reasonable or not. The students will have a detailed and holistic knowledge about the concerns and issues regarding algorithmic decision making and how to address them.

Study activities
- Lectures
- Individual studies
- Practical exercises (assignments)
- Final project
- Q+A sessions

All lectures will be 3 hours with one break of 15 min.

## Assessment

- First assignment: 15p
Decision tree example results using normal and biased dataset (python)

- Second assignment: 15p
Recommender system example (python)

- Final Project: 70p
To pass the course the student should, during the project work, show why and how automated decision making is designed and which potential issues and challenges may come with it. The use case will be a recommender system.

## Grading
- 70 - 75p Pass
- 76 - 81p
- 82 - 87p
- 88 - 93p
- 94 - 100p Excellent
