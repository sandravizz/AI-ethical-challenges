"The first generation of graduate students is matriculating who are focused explicitly on the ethics and safety of machine learning. The alignment problem's first responders have arrived at the scene."
Brian Christian

## Module overview
Arcada is a multi-professional University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki (Finland) with the philosophy to work across disciplines and advance culture and knowledge. The curriculum of each degree programme at Arcada is composed of modules. The modules define the competencies that you need to attain in order to graduate.

## Competency aims
The aim of this course is to provide the students with knowledge about thoughtful, responsible, and ethical uses of machine learning practice, which is a fundamental precondition to trustworthy development of AI. Recommendation systems, which simultaneously shape and predict the future in nearly all parts of human life, will be the main use case during the course.

## Learning outcomes
At the end of the course the student is expected to have an understanding of the techniques behind automated decision making systems related to common ML practice, combined with the skill to judge if the decision seems reasonable or not. The students will have a detailed and holistic knowledge about the concerns and issues regarding algorithmic decision making and how to address them.

Study activities
- Lectures
- Individual studies
- Practical exercises (assignments)
- Final project
- Q+A sessions

All lectures will be 3 hours with one break of 15 min.

## Assessment

- First assignment: 15p
Decision tree example results using normal and biased dataset (python)
- Second assignment: 15p
Recommender system example (python)
- Final Project: 70p
To pass the course the student should, during the project work, show why and how automated decision making is designed and which potential issues and challenges may come with it. The use case will be a recommender system.

## Grading
- 70 - 75p Pass
- 76 - 81p
- 82 - 87p
- 88 - 93p
- 94 - 100p Excellent

## Syllabus

### Limitations of AI 

*"Premature optimization is the root of all evil."* 

Products and services that rely on machine learning, computer programs that constantly absorb new data and adapt their decisions in response donâ€™t always make ethical or accurate choices.

The first part of the course is about the challenges and limitations of AI. No prediction will ever be 100% correct nor certain, which is acceptable in some case and unacceptable in others. How to be aware of these "errors" and how to address them together with the discussion about their application is the content of the two first lectures.

- Part 1 - 06/09/22
- Part 2 - 09/09/22

### Algorithmic Bias

*"The road to a civilized world goes through the dark woods of biases."*.    

Algorithmic bias is difficult to define. It is often understood as a systematic and repeatable error in computational systems, that is responsible for unfair, wrongful results of data processing. 

In this second part of the course we discussed the different types of algorithmic biases and their consequences especially regarding sexism and racism. 

- Part 1 - 13/09/22
- Part 2 - 16/09/22
- Assignment: Decision tree with ethical challenges (python)

### Recommender Systems 

*"Bluntly, technology is taken over advice."*.  

Recommender systems influence, the videos we watch, the books we read, the music we hear, the games we play, the investments we make, the friends we meet, the food we eat, the news we monitor, the products we buy, the software we code, the photos we share, the events we attend, the people we date, the jobs we apply for, in the end they practically and actually impact increasingly the life we live.

As humans are more and more follow algorithmic recommendation systems the impact also possible negative one needs discussion, which is happening in the third part of the course 

- Part 1 - 20/09/22
- Part 2 - 23/09/22
- Assignment: Simple recommender system (python)
- Part 3 - 27/09/22
- Part 4 - 30/09/22

### Final project 

*Build, explain and evaluate RS*

The idea is to deepen the student's knowledge about RS and their applications in real life using Spotify as a use case. Moreover they are asked to evaluate ethical challenges.
